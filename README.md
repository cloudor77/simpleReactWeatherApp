Hi, I am Martin, been exploring the corners, bits, spaces, and underneaths of Front-end/Full-stack development for a while now. Looking for ways to find the set of doors I can push open to get a job in the development industry. After having years spent in Sales/Consultant IT I have a pulsing desire to create a footprint I can always go and look back in retrospect. 

Here's one of the first apps I got together a while ago: Simple Weather App to gather the current weather situation in the city where I live. Nothing too fancy, a simple weather data React APP.


Overview:
- Use of open-meteo.com weather API to fetch data
- Weather code sheet helper to turn WMO Weather interpretation codes (numbers) into meaningful data
- Functional clock
- Full responsiveness - desktop, mobile


Installation:

- Download the folder/files
- Fire up your favorite code-editor, and navigate to the main folder with the package.json in it,
- Run your terminal - type in <em> npm install </em> and then <em> npm start </em>

Thank you.

M.
